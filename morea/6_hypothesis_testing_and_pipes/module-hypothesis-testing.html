<p>Building on the probability distribution concepts we covered in the previous module, this module discusses hypothesis testing. We will focus on the following steps:</p>

<p>1- Choosing an approprate test statistic
2- Determining a distribution for the chosen statistic 
3- Identifying the probability of obtaining the test statistic.</p>

<p>The next step is to see how actual statistical tests solve the third point using parametric (predetermined) distributions.</p>

<p>The module also introduces pipes, which are part of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code> package.</p>
