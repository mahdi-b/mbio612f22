Building on the probability distribution concepts we covered in the previous module, this module discusses hypothesis testing. We will focus on the following steps:

1- Choosing an approprate test statistic
2- Determining a distribution for the chosen statistic 
3- Identifying the probability of obtaining the test statistic. 

The next step is to see how actual statistical tests solve the third point using parametric (predetermined) distributions.

The module also introduces pipes, which are part of the `tidyverse` package.
