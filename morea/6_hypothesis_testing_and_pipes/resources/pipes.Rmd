### What are Pipes

* Pipes are used in a programming pradigm to chain operations
   * Output of one operation (function) becomes the input of the next operation (function)
* Pipes in `R` are represented using the pipe characters `%>%`
  * The functionality is included in the `magrittr` packagashg
  * Not part of tidyverse but get uploaded automatically when load `tidyvery`
  * You can load it explictely using
```
library(magrittr)  
```

```{r}
library(magrittr)  
```

### Why use Piping?

* The need to chain operations is common in Data Science

* Given some data, you may want to:

![](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sypx0knvwwk3437/ops_chaining.png?dl=1)

1. `remove_na()`: this function removes the missing values from the data
2. `normalize_data()`: this function normalized the datas so that mean=0 and std=1
3. `drop_outliers()`: remove data that is 3 std. deviations from the mean

* These operations need to be run consecutively on the data
* These three functions do not exist in `R`. We need to write them 

### Why use Piping? - Temp Variables

* Solution 1: creating temporary variables to hold the data

```R
# we do this first
data_no_na = remove_na(data)
# we do this second with the modified data
data_no_na_nromalized = normalize_data(data_no_na)
# we do this last with the results from the previous step
data_no_na_nromalized_no_outliers = drop_outliers(data_no_na_nromalized)
```

### Why use Piping? - Overwriting Variables

* The aproach above forces you to name each intermediate variable
  * those intermediate variables are not necessary. They clutter the code and slows down reading and writing
  * Prone to errors: common to pass the wrong temporary variable

* One way to deal with that is by overwriting the original data

### Why use Piping? - Overwriting Variables

* Solution 1: overwriting the data

```R
# we do this first
data = remove_na(data)
# we do this second with the modified data
data = normalize_data(data)
# we do this last with the results from the previous step
data = drop_outliers(data)
```

### Why use Piping? - Overwriting Variables

* Less typing and thinking but:

1 Makes debugging painful:
  * If you make an error you need to run the whole pipeline from the start (e.g.: read data)
2. Repeating the same var name makes it difficult to understand how it's changing
  * We wrote `data` 6 times, at least the first approach had a different variable name to explain (document) the operation

### Using the Pipe

* Using %>% we can chain function in a way that does not require intermediate variables
* The following operation
`data %>% do_something()`
translates into take data and pass as a first argument to do_something()

  * It's equivalent to do_something(data)

* we can further chain function and write
```
data %>%
  do_something() "%>%"
  do_something_else() "%>%"
```
This translates into
1. take data and pass it do_something()
  * i.e.,  `do_something(data)`
2. take result of `do_something(data)` and pass it to `do_something_else()`
      data_1 = do_something(data)
      data_2 = do_something_else(data_1)
 
* The above does not work when the function creates need to change some variable, as opposed to return data

### Putting it Together

* Using the pipe symbol, our code would look like as follows:

```
data %>%
  remove_na() %>%
  normalize_data() %>%
  drop_outliers()
```

* We will write these three function next

```{r}
remove_na <- function(x){
    x[!is.na(x)]
}
data = c(1,2,NA, 4,NA,6)
data_no_na = remove_na(data)
print(data_no_na)
```

```{r}
data %>% remove_na()
```

```{r}
data_no_na = data %>% remove_na()
print(data_no_na)
```

```{r}
data = rnorm(10, mean=180, sd=3)
print("data before")
print(data)

data = round(data, 2)
print("data after")
print(data)
```

```{r}
data = 10 %>%
  rnorm( mean=180, sd=3) %>%
  round(2)


mean(data)
sd(data)
```

```{r}
# center the data round 0
# normalized the sd to be 1
normalize_data = function(x){
    (x - mean(x))/sd(x)
}
data_normalized = normalize_data(data)


round(mean(data_normalized), 2)
sd(data_normalized)
```

```{r}
data_normalized_with_outlier  = c(-100, data_normalized, c(3000, 5000))
data_normalized_with_outlier
```

```{r}
drop_outliers = function(x){
    is_outlier = abs(x) > 3
    is_outlier
}

drop_outliers(data_normalized_with_outlier)
```

```{r}
drop_outliers = function(x){
    is_outlier = abs(x) > 3
    x[!is_outlier]
}

drop_outliers(data_normalized_with_outlier)
```

```{r}
data = 10 %>%
  rnorm( mean=180, sd=3) %>%
  round(2)

data_with_outlier = c(10000, data, 20000)
data_with_outlier
```

```{r}
data %>%
  remove_na() %>%
  normalize_data() %>%
  drop_outliers() %>%
  round(2)
```

### When to Use Pipes

* Pipes should be applied to a short sequence of operations
  * 5 to 6 operations
  * If longer, create intermediate operations and document the code thoroughly using comments

* This approach only works when you take a single object and return a new copy with some modification
