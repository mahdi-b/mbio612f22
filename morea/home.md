## Welcome to MBIO 612


The course introduces data science in the life sciences. Using the R programming language, students will gain the knowledge, skills, and abilities required for acquiring, processing, modeling, and visualizing tabular data. In addition to learning fundamental data science concepts, students will learn how to organize and structure data build reliable, maintainable R packages, and produce reproducible analyses. 

## Course Objectives


By the end of this course, students will:

  1. Become acquainted with the most popular methods, libraries, and
  best practices used in 1- data collection and organization, 2- data
  wrangling, 3- data exploration and visualization, 4- data modeling
  and interpretation.

  2. Gain experience with data science reproducibility best practices
  (i.e., software, empirical, and statistical reproducibility) through
  literate computing with RMarkdown, version control (Github),
  workflows, and automation.

  3. Become familiar with computing terminology, platforms, and
  paradigms used to solve data science problems.
