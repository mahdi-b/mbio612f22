Utilizing simple data sets, this [Jupyter notebook](./resources/apply_functions.ipynb) (or [Rmd Notebook](./resources/apply_functions.Rmd) ) provides an overview of the "apply" functions.

Please download the notebook and, in addition to reading the brief descriptions preceding each example, run the code and modify to gain a deeper understanding of how the functions work.


If you have questions or comments about the apply functions, please post them on #general on the course Slack workspace.
