An analyst or scientist spends the vast majority of their time cleaning and preparing data for analysis. Data must not only be cleaned but also transformed into various formats based on the model being used. Thus, it is often said that over 75% of a data analysis project's time is spent cleaning and preparing data and putting it into a format that is ready for analysis.

Data analysts should be familiar with the basic principles that define a tidy dataset. These readings describe how these principles can be implemented to avoid data redundancy inconsistencies and to produce datasets that are easy to maintain and go into different formats that are ingested by different models easily
