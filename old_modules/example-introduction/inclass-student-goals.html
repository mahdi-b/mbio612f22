<h1 id="in-class-what-are-your-goals">In Class: What are your goals?</h1>

<p>Break up into small groups and meet in one of the #class-breakout channels assigned to you by the instructor.  Elect one person to be the scribe and take notes. Use a shared google doc or something similar so that everyone can see the notes as they are being written.</p>

<p>Decide on your team name (very important!)</p>

<p>Answer the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>What does your group consider to be the 3-6 most important goals for ICS 314?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What learning strategies will be effective in achieving these goals?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What risk factors might prevent you from achieving these goals?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>After approximately 10 minutes, we will gather together and a spokesperson from each group will present the results of their work.</p>

<p><strong>Please enable your video camera while you are in your breakout room!  It makes the experience much better for everyone and can even raise the quality of your work.</strong></p>
