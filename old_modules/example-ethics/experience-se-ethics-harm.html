<p>We noted above that failures of critical software systems can result in catastrophic loss
of life or injury to the public. If such failures result, directly or indirectly, from software
engineers’ choices to ignore their professional obligations, then these harms are clearly
the consequences of unethical professional behavior. Those responsible each bear the
moral weight of this avoidable human suffering, whether or not this also results in legal,
criminal or professional punishment.</p>

<p>But what other kinds of harms do software engineers have an ethical duty to consider, and
to try to prevent? Consider the following scenario:</p>

<h2 id="case-study-1-college-for-sarah">Case Study 1: College for Sarah</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Mike is a father of 3, and in order to save for their college educations, he has
been working two jobs since his kids were born. His daughter Sarah has
worked as hard as she can in high school to get high grades and SAT scores;
as a result of her hard work she has been accepted to a prestigious IvyLeague
college, and the deposit for her first year is due today. If the deposit
goes unpaid, Sarah loses her spot in the freshman class. Mike paid the bill
last week, but today he gets an email from the college admissions office
saying that his payment was rejected for insufficient funds by his bank, and
if he does not make the payment by the end of the day, Sarah will lose her
place and be unable to attend in the Fall. </p>

<p>Panicked, Mike calls the bank – he
had more than enough money in his savings to cover the bill, so he cannot
understand what has happened. The bank confirms that his account had
plenty of funds the day before, but cannot tell him why the funds are gone
now or why the payment was rejected. They tell him there must be some
‘software glitch’ involved and that they will open an investigation, but that
it will take weeks to resolve. They will only restore the funds in his account
once the investigation is completed and the cause found. Mike has no other
way to get the money for the deposit on such short notice, and has to tell
Sarah that he couldn’t cover the bill despite his earlier promise, and that she
won’t be attending college in the Fall.

<h4 id="questions-for-discussion">Questions for discussion:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Clearly harm has occurred, but does this scenario represent unethical behavior on the part of a software engineer?  Come up with one example of a “software glitch” which does not result from unethical behavior on the part of a software engineer, and one that does.  Justify your examples by reference to either the <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a> or the <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/se-code">Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice</a>.</li>

<h2 id="case-study-2-errand-whiz">Case Study 2: Errand Whiz</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Karen is a young lawyer at a prestigious firm with an incredibly hectic and
stressful schedule, who needs to organize what little free time she has more
efficiently. She has just downloaded a new app called Errand Whiz onto her
iPhone; this app merges information from Karen’s to-do list, information on
her purchasing habits from retail stores she shops at, and GPS software to
produce the most efficient map and directions for running errands on her days
off. Based on what it knows about what she needs to purchase and her general
shopping habits, it tells Karen what locations of her favorite stores to visit on
a given day, in what order and by what routes – this way she can get her
errands done in the least amount of time, traveling the least number of miles.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, the app aggregates information not only about where she
lives and shops, but also tracks what she typically buys in each store, how
much she buys, what she typically pays for each item. This collected data is
not stored on Karen’s phone, but on a separate server that the app links to
when it needs to create a shopping map. The app encourages users to log in
via Facebook, as the developers have made a deal with Facebook to sell this
data to third-party advertisers, for the purpose of targeting Facebook ads to
Karen and her friends.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="questions-for-discussion-1">Questions for discussion:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>In what ways could Karen potentially be harmed by this app,
depending on how it is designed and how her shopping data is handled and used?
Identify a few harmful scenarios you can think of, and the types of harm she could
suffer in each.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Which if any of these harms could result from ethical failings on
the part of the people who developed Errand Whiz? How, specifically?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What actions could the people behind Errand Whiz take to prevent
these harms? Are they ethically obligated to prevent them? Why or why not?

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Ideally, these scenarios have helped to broaden your understanding of the ethical scope
of software engineering. In considering and protecting the ‘health, safety and welfare’ of
the public, we must not limit our thinking to those contexts in which our design choices
or coding practices have the potential to cause someone’s death, or cause them direct
physical injury. The harms that people can suffer as a result of failures by software engineers to
consider their ethical obligation to the public are far more numerous and more complex than we
might think.</p>
