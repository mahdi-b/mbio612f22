<p><a href="http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> (CTCI) is widely regarded as a preeminent resource to prepare for modern software development position interviews at leading high tech companies.</p>

<p>The goal of this experience is to continue to get familiar with writing very simple Javascript code using <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">JSFiddle</a>, and to get you acquainted with the “Workout of the Day” (WOD) pedagogical technique used in this course.</p>

<p>To do this, you will solve the very first problem in CTCI, called “isUnique”:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1.1. Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="language-js highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">isUnique</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">abcde</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">));</span>  <span class="c1">// prints true</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">isUnique</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">abcdea</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">));</span> <span class="c1">// prints false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You should probably have finished the previous practice WOD.</p>

<p>Review the first few sections of the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript">AirBnB Javascript Style Guide</a>. For example, be sure to use let and const, not var.</p>

<p>Next, login to JSFiddle (creating an account if you haven’t already).</p>

<p>Check the settings pane to make sure the console window is displayed in the editor, and the layout is to your liking (I prefer “Tabs (rows)”).</p>

<p>To make the result window dark for your new JSFiddle, add the following to the CSS pane:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>body { background-color: #1f2227; }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You may also want to reduce the height of the result window, so that more space is provided for the Javascript window.</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished trying to do it, watch me do it:</p>

<div class="video-container">

</div>

<h2 id="submission-instructions">Submission Instructions</h2>

<p>By the time and date indicated on the Schedule page, submit this assignment via Laulima.</p>

<p>Your submission should contain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A link to the JSFiddle.  Make sure you include the complete URL so that I can click on it in my mailer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The number of times you have attempted this assignment so far, and for each time, how long it took you.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You will receive full credit for this practice WOD as long as you have attempted it at least once and submitted your work on Laulima with all required data before the due date. Your code does not have to run perfectly for you to receive full credit.</p>
