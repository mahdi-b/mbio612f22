<h2 id="summary-of-results">Summary of results</h2>

<p>Here are the results of this assessment, which took place on July 23, 2021:</p>

<script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@3.4.1/dist/chart.min.js"></script>

<!---
  If you want to include a chart, you must supply the following parameters in your page's YAML:
    morea_chartjs_labels: An array of strings reprsenting each bar in the histogram.
    morea_chartjs_data: An array of numbers, one per label.
    morea_chartjs_colors: An array of colors, one per label
  Note that the syntax is pretty weird: the YAML specifies a string which is inserted below and then evaluated.
